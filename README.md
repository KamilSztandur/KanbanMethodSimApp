### IMPORTANT NOTE
Main stage of this project's development has ended. There are not going to be any new commits unless any crucial errors or bugs are discovered which have to be fixed in order to maintain the current functionalities of Kanban Method's Simulator.

It's been my biggest project yet and I've learnt a lot. It was pure fun but I have to move on.
